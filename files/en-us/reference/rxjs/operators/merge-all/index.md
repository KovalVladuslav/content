# MergeAll

## Description

This operator combines all emitted inner streams and just as with plain merge concurrently produces values from each
stream. In the diagram below you can see the H higher-order stream that produces two inner streams A and B. The mergeAll
operator combines values from these two streams and then passes them through to the resulting sequence as they occur.
